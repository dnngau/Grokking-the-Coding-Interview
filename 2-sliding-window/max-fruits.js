 * @title Fruits into Baskets (Medium)
 * 
 * @problemStatement You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit trees. You will be given two baskets, and your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.
 * 
 * You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree. The farm has following restrictions:
 * 
 * 1) Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
 * 2) You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
 * 3) You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
 * 
 * Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
 * 
 * @example1
 * Input: Fruit = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
 * 
 * @example2
 * Input: Fruit = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket. This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C'
